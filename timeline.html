            <div class="stuff">
                <p>This is a timeline of all important parts of the ARG.<br>A lot of stuff on this page comes from previous documentation (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L8lss64v4yhjFzelrjX8q4ZSDIsvua9RwOeRL5b4K_0/edit">here</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Xw-MhgRxrfVnq03DkDZH8orkmXMzf-UT1CAMH6GxM08/edit">here</a>, and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OAVch6j-dHt7E3CJh1y9it2GqC5NZnfeXP4UYUHTI1c/edit">here</a>). Huge thanks to everyone who helped make those!</p>

                <h2>Is Bill Cipher in Owl House?</h2>

                <p><img src="billcipherFIRE.png" alt="FIRE" width=1000>On April 28th, 2023, HalfBreadChaos uploaded the video “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9y1S0K48EVc">Is Bill Cipher in Owl House?</a>".<br>At around 12:54, flame sprites can be seen flickering. The first and last flames come from the sprite spr_hearthflame in Undertale and have no meaning, however there are 4 different flames in the middle. 3 of these flames have different colors, and the other has an eye on it, which is a clue for the meaning of the flame (“I").<br><br>With future knowledge, we can translate the flames to the message “FIRE".</p>

                <h2>How Many Hits Does It Take to Kill the Mad Dummy</h2>

                <p><img src="maddummyWANNA.png" alt="WANNA FIRE" width=991 class="pixel">On May 12th, 2023, Bread uploaded the video “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skh6FmR_uuE">How Many Hits Does It Take to Kill the Mad Dummy</a>".<br>Near the end of the video, Bread discusses some strategies that MysticSlime's Youtube Plays Undertale chat could have used to make the Mad Dummy fight easier. At 9:13, they say “I mean it's moot point now, since MysticSlime's stream is now over... but... suppose it was-", but then the video is cut off by a glitch effect.<br><br>After the glitch, 2 new sets of flames can be seen, one on the front and one on the back. Each set scrolls one flame forward every few frames.<br>The 5 flames looping on the front have a few hints for their meaning: “uu" (“double u", “W"), “hA" in wingdings (the letter is “A", and the “h" specifies how it's pronounced), N from Pokémon (the letter “N"), N again, and “hA" again. Put together, these flames mean “WANNA".<br>On the back, 3 of the flames are blank. The other flame has an eye on it, which, like in the previous video, means “I". Also like in the previous video, we now know that these flames spell “FIRE".<br><br>The text “TO BE CONTINUED?" can then be seen in wingdings, which turns into normal text for a short time, and then into the [REDACTED] sprite.</p>

                <h2>Initial discovery</h2>

                <p><img src="bric.png" alt="hey look its bric" width=558>On May 13th, 2023, Deltarune theorist Brixbraxium noticed the flames in the video for the first time, and started talking about them in the <a href="https://discord.gg/VxB7DR3JFC">Andrew Cunningham Discord Server</a> (<span class="nowrap"><span class="flip">A</span>CDS</span>).<br>A few people joined the discussion, such as PenguinPowerful and Icebrick1. They found the different symbols in the flames, and quickly understood what each one meant individually, but trying to piece it all together, they were just getting gibberish.<br><br>Brix then created <a href="https://discord.com/channels/919115374316908584/1106740444773232761/1106740582279290931">a thread</a> for this topic, where he theorized that this was teasing a Chat Plays Undertale run by Bread. The group kept discussing the symbols and the possibility of a Chat Plays for a couple days, however they still couldn't understand the meaning of the flames.</p>

                <p><img src="comment.png" alt="hearted comment" width=902 class="right">On May 21st, Bread hearted a comment Brix had left on the video, much later than they usually look at comments, which was immediately seen as important.</p>

                <h2>First community post</h2>

                <p><img src="communityWANNA.png" alt="WANNA community post" width=500>On May 26th, 2023, Bread made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/post/UgkxFHndjjNgMRymEL9A0pfGXeSTdMuEC2gp">a community post</a> announcing that that weeks video would be a few days late. There are 5 flames scattered across the images on the post, which say the same thing as in the Mad Dummy video: “WANNA".<br><br>Still, the group was unable to figure out what they meant, instead theorizing that this could be a cipher or a bit.ly link.</p>

                <h2>Everything we know about Redacted in Undertale</h2>

                <p><img src="redactedPLAY.png" alt="PLAY" width=500>On May 29th, 2023, Bread uploaded “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QIV_aVOp78">Everything we know about Redacted in Undertale</a>".<br>At around 11:14, the screen explodes, and 4 flames can be seen randomly switching places around the screen for a few frames. These flames have some clues for their meaning: the first, third and fourth are P, A, and Y in wingdings, respectively, and the second is the character L from Death Note.<br>Also, the A flame here looks different from the A flame in WANNA. This is because the fire alphabet has different flames for different sounds of the same letters. The A in WANNA makes an “Ah" sound, while the A in PLAY makes an “Ay" sound.<br><br>Put together with the flames from the previous video, the message so far is “WANNA PLAY".</p>

                <p><img src="comment2.png" alt="hearted comment 2" width=600>Brix commented on this video too, and again, the comment got hearted by Bread. They also replied to it, saying there was an entire community dissecting these where they can't see it, referring to the <span class="nowrap"><span class="flip">A</span>CDS</span> thread. After just a few minutes, the group figured out this meant PLAY, and, looking back at the previous video, they understood the full message to mean “I WANNA PLAY" or “HI WANNA PLAY".<br><br>After decoding the meaning, Brix realized that someone must have told Bread about them investigating the flames.<br>Penguin joked that there were spies from Bread's Patreon server telling them about it, and Brix joked about Bread being in the server on an alt.<br><br>Brix then left another comment on the video, mentioning what they had found so far. This one also was hearted by Bread, prompting more jokes about Bread's alt being there. The group then started looking at every account that joined, in case one of them actually was Bread.</p>

                <h2>Patreon invites</h2>
                <p><img src="patreon.png" alt="after patreon invites or smth idk im tired why am i writing alt text">On May 31st, 2023, an account named Quinn joined the server. Quinn being the name of one of Bread's cats, along with many other signs, this was quickly noticed the next day as their alt. Bread also found out that the group knew about this.<br><br>While many messages about what happened are still up on another thread, a lot of the discussion on the ARG thread was deleted at some point. They also started discussing Bread video lore to hide the alt jokes.<br>After a few hours of discussion, Bread DM'd a few of the people involved, and gave them free invites to the Patreon server to properly discuss the ARG, as a reward for being the first people to discover it. They also confirmed that their editor, Mollystars, had told them about the thread.</p>

                <p>more stuff probably coming soon</p>
