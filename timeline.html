            <div class="stuff">
                <p>This is a timeline of all important parts of the ARG.<br>A lot of stuff on this page comes from previous documentation (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L8lss64v4yhjFzelrjX8q4ZSDIsvua9RwOeRL5b4K_0/edit">here</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Xw-MhgRxrfVnq03DkDZH8orkmXMzf-UT1CAMH6GxM08/edit">here</a>, and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dKw3JYYZp0igw0L7ZHTCje-Bc9d_Qh2AleEecxZcU9Y/edit">here</a>). Huge thanks to everyone who helped make those!</p>

                <h2>Is Bill Cipher in Owl House?</h2>

                <p><img src="billcipherFIRE.png" alt="FIRE" width=800>On April 28th, 2023, HalfBreadChaos uploaded the video “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9y1S0K48EVc">Is Bill Cipher in Owl House?</a>".<br>At around 12:54, flame sprites can be seen flickering. The first and last flames come from the sprite spr_hearthflame in Undertale and have no meaning, however there are 4 different flames in the middle. 3 of these flames have different colors, and the other has an eye on it, which is a clue for the meaning of the flame (“I").<br><br>With future knowledge, we can translate the flames to the message “FIRE".</p>

                <h2>How Many Hits Does It Take to Kill the Mad Dummy</h2>

                <p><img src="maddummyWANNA.png" alt="WANNA FIRE" width=800 class="pixel">On May 12th, 2023, Bread uploaded the video “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skh6FmR_uuE">How Many Hits Does It Take to Kill the Mad Dummy</a>".<br>Near the end of the video, Bread discusses some strategies that MysticSlime's Youtube Plays Undertale chat could have used to make the Mad Dummy fight easier. At 9:13, they say “I mean it's moot point now, since MysticSlime's stream is now over... but... suppose it was-", but then the video is cut off by a glitch effect.<br><br>After the glitch, 2 new sets of flames can be seen, one on the front and one on the back. Each set scrolls one flame forward every few frames.<br>The 5 flames looping on the front have a few hints for their meaning: “uu" (“double u", “W"), “hA" in wingdings (the letter is “A", and the “h" specifies how it's pronounced), N from Pokémon (the letter “N"), N again, and “hA" again. Put together, these flames mean “WANNA".<br>On the back, 3 of the flames are blank. The other flame has an eye on it, which, like in the previous video, means “I". Also like in the previous video, we now know that these flames spell “FIRE".<br><br>The text “TO BE CONTINUED?" can then be seen in wingdings, which turns into normal text for a short time, and then into the [REDACTED] sprite.</p>

                <h2>Initial discovery</h2>

                <p><img src="bric.png" alt="hey look its bric" width=558>On May 13th, 2023, Deltarune theorist Brixbraxium noticed the flames in the video for the first time, and started talking about them in the <a href="https://discord.gg/VxB7DR3JFC">Andrew Cunningham Discord Server</a> (<span class="nowrap"><span class="flip">A</span>CDS</span>).<br>A few people joined the discussion, such as PenguinPowerful and Icebrick1. They found the different symbols in the flames, and quickly understood what each one meant individually, but trying to piece it all together, they were just getting gibberish.<br><br>Brix then created <a href="https://discord.com/channels/919115374316908584/1106740444773232761/1106740582279290931">a thread</a> for this topic, where he theorized that this was teasing a Chat Plays Undertale run by Bread. The Fire Gang kept discussing the symbols and the possibility of a Chat Plays for a couple days, however they still couldn't understand the meaning of the flames.</p>

                <p><img src="comment.png" alt="hearted comment" width=902 class="right">On May 21st, Bread hearted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skh6FmR_uuE&lc=Ugx-kZypvftvAx0OsUV4AaABAg">a comment</a> Brix had left on the video, much later than they usually look at comments, which was immediately seen as important.</p>

                <h2>First community post</h2>

                <p><img src="communityWANNA.png" alt="WANNA community post" width=500>On May 26th, 2023, Bread made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/post/UgkxFHndjjNgMRymEL9A0pfGXeSTdMuEC2gp">a community post</a> announcing that that weeks video would be a few days late. There are 5 flames scattered across the images on the post, which say the same thing as in the Mad Dummy video: “WANNA".<br><br>Still, the Fire Gang was unable to figure out what they meant, instead theorizing that this could be a cipher or a bit.ly link.</p>

                <h2>Everything we know about Redacted in Undertale</h2>

                <p><img src="redactedPLAY.png" alt="PLAY" width=500>On May 29th, 2023, Bread uploaded “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QIV_aVOp78">Everything we know about Redacted in Undertale</a>".<br>At around 11:14, the screen explodes, and 4 flames can be seen randomly switching places around the screen for a few frames. These flames have some clues for their meaning: the first, third and fourth are P, A, and Y in wingdings, respectively, and the second is the character L from Death Note.<br>Also, the A flame here looks different from the A flame in WANNA. This is because the fire alphabet has different flames for different sounds of the same letters. The A in WANNA makes an “Ah" sound, while the A in PLAY makes an “Ay" sound.<br><br>Put together with the flames from the previous video, the message so far is “WANNA PLAY".</p>

                <p><img src="comment2.png" alt="hearted comment 2" width=600>Brix <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QIV_aVOp78&lc=Ugz4nidHIPmkTsEzmed4AaABAg">commented</a> on this video too, and again, the comment got hearted by Bread. They also replied to it, saying there was an entire community dissecting these where they can't see it, referring to the <span class="nowrap"><span class="flip">A</span>CDS</span> thread. After just a few minutes, the Fire Gang figured out these flames meant PLAY, and, looking back at the previous video, they understood the full message to mean “I WANNA PLAY" or “HI WANNA PLAY".<br><br>After decoding the meaning, Brix realized that someone must have told Bread about them investigating the flames.<br>Penguin joked that there were spies from Bread's Patreon server telling them about it, and Brix joked about Bread being in the server on an alt.<br><br>Brix then left <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QIV_aVOp78&lc=UgwXXm7NPIZC31ReEqB4AaABAg">another comment</a> on the video, mentioning what they had found so far. This one also was hearted by Bread, prompting more jokes about Bread's alt being there. The Fire Gang then started looking at every account that joined, in case one of them actually was Bread.</p>

                <h2>Patreon invites</h2>

                <p><img src="patreon.png" alt="after patreon invites or smth idk im tired why am i writing alt text">On May 31st, 2023, an account named Quinn joined the server.<br>On the thread, Penguin asked if the account was suspicious. <a href="https://ccerisegd.github.io/firebackup/patreon/backup&id=1113843998591828009">A group chat</a> was then made, where the gang discussed how possible it was for the account to be Bread. They quickly noticed that Quinn was the name of one of Bread's cats, and that it had an about me mentioning cats, among other things. They then deleted some of the messages about the account in the thread, and started discussing Bread video lore to act like everything was normal.<br><br>Around an hour later, Brix mentioned not having access to Bread's server because it was paywalled. Bread then DM'd a few of the people involved, and gave them free invites to the Patreon server to properly discuss the ARG, as a reward for being the first people to discover it. They also confirmed that their editor, Mollystars, had told them about the thread.<br><br><a href="https://ccerisegd.github.io/firebackup/patreon/backup.html">A channel</a> was then created for the ARG, where the main discussion moved to for the next few weeks.</p>

                <h2>First TPU test stream</h2>

                <p><img src="fcw.png" alt="FLAMES CRACKLE AND WHISPER" width=400>On June 5th, 2023, Bread announced <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1838268087">a bug testing stream</a> for Twitch Plays Undertale, where people had access to a few unused rooms to try and find bugs in the console.<br><br>During a stream on June 7th, Bread asked Mel-Woif how they typed wingdings. They said they use a translator, and tried saying “<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1839802692?t=42453s">TESTING TESTING</a>" in wingdings. The console then printed some broken ASCII art. A few minutes later, Bread managed to fix the issue, and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1839802692?t=42588s">using wingdings</a> started showing the correct fire ASCII art.<br><br>With future knowledge, we can translate this message as “FLAMES CRACKLE AND WHISPER", though it has an artstyle that's not used in any other ASCII fire messages.<br><br>The Fire Gang wondered if these flames had meaning, however they had no way of translating the message, so it wasn't even mentioned outside of Twitch chat for a few days.</p>

                <h2>Second community post</h2>

                <p><img src="communityWITH.png" alt="WITH" width=600>On June 9th, 2023, Bread made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/post/UgkxlS8TgKdEI_dei33zUKj0ohp92ki33_CR">a community post</a> talking about the test streams.<br><br>One of the images was a screenshot of the previously found “FLAMES CRACKLE AND WHISPER" message. However, it had a few changes: two of the flames on the console had wingdings on them, reading “WI", and Bread's sprite in the corner had two flames added, with wingdings on top reading “TH". This made the full message so far “HI WANNA PLAY WITH". The Fire Gang speculated that it could continue as “HI WANNA PLAY WITH ME".</p>

                <h2>A new voice</h2>

                <p><img src="newvoice.png" alt="A NEW VOICE? HIYA" width=800>On June 12th, 2023, Lindfate said “<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1844225871?t=50269s">hi wanna play</a>" in wingdings in chat.<br>The console then printed a new fire message, which we now know means “A NEW VOICE? HIYA". The trigger for this message was meant to be “hi wanna play with fire", however, due to a coding error, it triggered with just “play"<br><br>After experimenting for a few minutes, the Fire Gang found another fire message. It triggered when saying “<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1844225871?t=50549s">hi wanna play</a>" more than once, and was just the last word from the other message: “HIYA". However, the flames in this message were labelled with their respective letters.<br><br>The Fire Gang discussed what this meant, wondering what “HIYA" was and theorizing this could lead to Bread making a game, or, a flamethrower brand, for some reason.<br><br>Brix mentioned this could be the last fire message, which Bread said was bold to assume.</p>

                <h2>Flame labels</h2>

                <p><img src="labelled.png" alt="FLAME CAN WHISPER" width=800>A few hours later, the code was updated, labelling some flames in the fire messages.<br>The original “FLAMES CRACKLE AND WHISPER" message <a href="https://discord.com/channels/919115374316908584/1106740444773232761/1117830227322744834">was changed</a> to show labels on the letters “FLAME C AN WHISPER", while “A NEW VOICE? HIYA" had labels <a href="https://ccerisegd.github.io/firebackup/patreon/backup&id=1117950808206618686">added</a> on “NEW VOICE".<br><br>The gang discussed for a few minutes whether this could mean the flames made meaningful sounds; this ended up not being the case, though.</p>

                <h2>Twitch Plays Undertale server</h2>

                <p><img src="burnttoash.png" alt="message burnt to ash">On June 13th, 2023, Bread sent an invite to <a href="https://discord.gg/nvQburYkWJ">a new server</a> made for Twitch Plays Undertale.<br><br>Some time after joining, the Fire Gang started discussing the fire messages they had found so far. However, after just a few minutes, something odd happened: when saying certain keywords related to the ARG, such as “i wanna play with fire", “in the flames", or “fire message", the message would be <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1117766959266791484/1118149995670032495/1118215783563141272">deleted</a>, and automod would then say it “burnt to ash"; it would also give you the Glass role, which granted access to the <a href="link.html?p=1.html">Fire channel</a>. Within the Fire channel, it would send another message, saying “You hear a voice crackling through the flames...". It then quickly deleted both messages.</p>

                <h2>Testing stream signs</h2>

                <p><img src="signs.png" alt="signs" width=900>Later that day, Brix, Penguin, ChaoticCookie and YanaTheWeird managed to beat Sans while using a buffed Temmie Armor.<br>When they walked farther into the Judgement Hall, they saw <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1846007925?t=0h0m36s">a sign</a>, which read “Be silent at the cross.". This was a hint for the flame alphabet, as flames with a cross shaped wisp indicate silent letters. However, this was not known at the time.<br><br>After defeating Sans, the Fire Gang also got access to New Home. They started backtracking through the CORE, until they reached Hotland, where they realized they could enter Mettaton's tile puzzle room from the other side, skipping the puzzle. However, when they got there, they accidentally went back into the door, putting them back in the Judgement Hall, and with Sans still alive.<br><br>For a short time they thought they would have to beat Sans again, however, they realized that they had saved while backtracking. They then went to the tile puzzle, and intentionally lost, which let them go back to the menu, and get back to New Home. They again backtracked to Hotland, and managed to read <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1846007925?t=0h21m53s">the sign</a>: “Every flame has a sound. Have you heard them before?". This also was a hint for the flame alphabet, as each flame represents a sound.<br><br>The next day, <a href="https://ccerisegd.github.io/firebackup/patreon/backup&id=1118544105442648094">echo flowers</a> were added to the hub, one repeating “Every flame has a sound..." “Have you heard them before?", the other simply saying “cross". The message “You got it! Hold your breath beneath the cross." was also <a href="link.html?p=1&id=1119003085755383929">added</a> later that day, though exactly where is unknown.<br>A few hours later, <a href="link.html?p=1&id=1118587567806349312">another sign</a> was found, saying “Come on, you can figure this one out. Each flame is a letter, silly!".</p>

                <h2>Flame alphabet deciphering</h2>

                <p><img src="decoding.png" width=700>Seeing those signs, the Fire Gang started considering that unlabelled flames also had a meaning.<br>They started trying to figure out the meaning of the messages they had so far by trying to match flames between them. The message labelled “NEW VOICE" was easy enough, as the bottom line was the same as the message labelled “HIYA", and the first flame could be matched to the “A" in that message. This way, they arrived at “<a href="https://discord.com/channels/1117766959266791484/1118149918251552788/1118603750928552057">A NEW VOICE HIYA</a>".<br><br> However, when trying to understand the “FLAMES CAN WHISPER" message, there was a problem: some flames that were labelled with the same letter were completely different from each other. They argued about what words could possibly fit, and started <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1117766959266791484/1118149918251552788/1118617412724588604">a conspiracy board</a> to keep track of the fire messages.<br>While they managed to be kind of certain about “FLAMES C------ AND WHISPER", they weren't able to agree on the other word, as they weren't certain over whether some flames were the same or not.<br><br>Brix then got help from Retro X Zeta, who concluded that the particles around the flames were relevant to the meaning, altering pronounciation, or the entire letter. Particularly, cross particles indicated silent letters.<br><br>They managed to translate the whole message to “<a href="https://discord.com/channels/1117766959266791484/1118149918251552788/1118633279587881060">FLAMES CRACKLE AND WHISPER</a>".<br><br>There was also discussion regarding the artstyles of the flames; some people believed that the “FLAMES CRACKLE AND WHISPER" message was actually a different fire language from the others. The next day, on June 15th, however, Bread <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1117766959266791484/1118149918251552788/1118982926013575269">confirmed</a> this was just ASCII art jank. Still, people theorized there wasnt a consistent fire alphabet at all.</p>

                <h2>Twitch Plays Undertale Announcement</h2>

                <p><img src="announcement.png" alt="fire ig" width=800>On June 17th, 2023, Bread uploaded the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRZXmyQRP38">Twitch Plays Undertale Announcement</a>, where they explained how the console worked and set a start date for the stream.<br>At 3:49, while talking about how the console can accept different wordings for commands, they say “as long as you don't use wingdi-", before being cut off by a glitch effect for a few frames.<br><br>During the glitch, the ASCII flames in the console turn to sprites, which have their respective letters labelled in wingdings: “FLAMES CRACKLE AND WHISPEL", the last character being a typo. Below them, more flames can be seen in Twitch Chat. There are wingdings next to them indicating their meaning, “WITH".<br>New signs can then be seen on the corner of the video. The first one reads “Can you hear me? You're all so quiet...". A few frames later, another sign is visible: “Oh no! You shouldn't leave anyone in the dark! What if they get cold? ):".<br><br>At 6:22, Bread can be seen whacking their computer with a broom, causing flames to appear on it. These flames are labelled, having a Wingdings F, an eye (“I"), Wingdings R, and Wingdings E. The E is also crossed out, hinting at it being a silent letter.<br><br>These flames complete the full message, “HI WANNA PLAY WITH FIRE".<br><br>The Fire Gang quickly found all the messages on the video. They then attempted to translate fire that was visible in Breads eye for a few frames back in the Bill Cipher video, which Bread <a href="link.html?p=1&id=1119429464435195904">confirmed</a> were just Hearthflame and had no meaning.</p>

                <h2>Twitch Plays Undertale first run start</h2>

                <p><img src="charts.png" alt="e" width=800>Later that same day, the first full Twitch Plays Undertale run started, during which many new people joined the ARG channel and helped solve the puzzles.<br>The Fire Gang kept trying to find new fire messages, and, doing this, they thought that “FLAMES CRACKLE AND WHISPER" was unlabelled again; this was just because the person typing in wingdings hadn't said “HI WANNA PLAY WITH FIRE", though. They also noticed that the “Y" in “HIYA" had slightly changed.<br><br>Cookie's brother attempted to find patterns in the flames after hearing about the ARG. He found that the flames matched if they were different pronounciations of the same letters, and made <a href="link.html?p=1&id=1120508430067703938">a chart</a> noting some similarities between the flames.<br>The next day, Terbium checked all the fire messages, and arranged the flames into another <a href="link.html?p=1&id=1119958391519981728">fire alphabet chart</a>.<br>Bootleg Matpat then <a href="link.html?p=1&id=1120004633151152239">found</a> the flames in the Bill Cipher video, however the Fire Gang was unable to decode them.<br><br>On June 21st, Bread got annoyed and sent <a href="link.html?p=1&id=1120966524350500865">a message</a> with a cipher. This ended up just being a red herring though, as we now know it is a vigenere cipher using “youshouldntleaveanyoneinthedark" as the key, translating to “My time has come to burn! I invoke this ancient power that I may return!"</p>

                <h2>More flame deciphering</h2>

                <p><img src="moredeciphering.png" alt="with, new voice" width=700>Later on June 21st, the Fire Gang realized that the flames next to the “WITH" wingdings also said the same thing, “WITH", and <a href="link.html?p=1&id=1121086708528709735">added</a> the new T flame to the chart.<br><br>On June 22nd, the gang found that the “A NEW VOICE? HIYA" message had had its artstyle and labels changed, now having a shorter C and only showing “<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1858586719?t=4h54m45s">E O</a>". Bread confirmed that the artstyle changes were just due to “<a href="link.html?p=1&id=1121298139861762098">Early installment weirdness</a>".<br>The gang also tried to check the messages in previous videos, and, after a few hours, they managed to figure out that the fire on the back of the Mad Dummy video said “FIRE". They also noticed that the “h" indicated pronounciation, and the “I" wasn't part of the front message, which finally completed the correct message, “WANNA PLAY WITH FIRE".<br>A few more hours of decoding later, the flames in the Bill Cipher video were also translated to “<a href="link.html?p=2&id=1121482316125048953">FIRE</a>".</p>

                <h2>New join messages</h2>

                <p><img src="staywarm.png" alt="Oh no! You're all leaving? Stay warm, okay?!" width=900>On June 23rd, shortly after chat managed to beat the game for the first time, the automod burn message was changed.<br>When a new person joined the fire channel, it <a href="link.html?p=2&id=1121685923487285278">now said</a>: “Oh no! You're all leaving? Stay warm, okay?!". The Fire Gang theorized this message was about leaving Twitch chat, and that it might have been added to the bot because they missed it in the console.<br>When the next person joined a few hours later, the message had been changed <a href="link.html?p=2&id=1121737002019205170">back to normal</a>.<br><br>Seeing this, people theorized that “Don't leave anyone in the dark" meant that they should get more people in the ARG, as the bot might give new messages when they joined. When other people opposed this idea, Bread reacted with an ice emoji, indicating that they were wrong. The gang then started telling people outside the channel how to join. At this point, Icebrick also started the first <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L8lss64v4yhjFzelrjX8q4ZSDIsvua9RwOeRL5b4K_0/edit#heading=h.erbtj09oy1cx">ARG documentation</a>.<br><br>After a few more people joined and got the normal message, it changed again a few times. It <a href="link.html?p=2&id=1121877533789528135">first said</a> “See you soon!", and <a href="link.html?p=2&id=1121879865872896100">then</a> “You hear a voice crackling through the flames... but you can't quite make it out yet...". The same message kept appearing for everyone who joined in the next few hours. The gang also guessed that something special would happen when 100 people got the Glass role.<br><br>The next day, the message <a href="link.html?p=2&id=1121990174667186251">changed again</a>, this time saying “You hear a voice calling out from the flames, but the sound is swallowed up before you can respond". This message also kept repeating for the next few days; reaching 100 people did not give anything.</p>

                <h2>Can you hear me?</h2>

                <p><img src="soquiet.png" alt="fire" width=800>On June 27th, 2023, new test streams started. During these, the Fire Gang soon found new flames added to the console.<br><br>There were 4 messages found, which seemed to have a random chance to trigger with any message, and we now know translate to “<a href="link.html?p=2&id=1123066347232972821">I HEAR YOU YOU HEAR ME?</a>", “<a href="link.html?p=2&id=1123067110499819541">CCAN YOU HEAR ME?</a>", “<a href="link.html?p=2&id=1123069397649604708">PLEASE TALK TO ME!</a>", and “<a href="link.html?p=2&id=1123070608008290374">WWHY ARE YOU SO QUIET?</a>".<br>The second message, “CCAN YOU HEAR ME?", had its N incorrectly marked as silent, which was shortly <a href="link.html?p=2&id=1123094651109388318">fixed</a> by Bread, and then <a href="link.html?p=2&id=1123118891040768102">again</a> due to a wisp being flipped. The third, “PLEASE TALK TO ME!", also had to be <a href="link.html?p=2&id=1123108024698019860">fixed</a> (and <a href="link.html?p=2&id=1123112590143402075">again</a>, and <a href="link.html?p=2&id=1123126911137235035">again</a>) because of a mistake on the first A, a missing wisp on the last E, and the last A being too tall.<br><br>After decoding for some time, the gang managed to translate “<a href="link.html?p=2&id=1123107246612693042">PLEASE TALK TO ME</a>", and, a few minutes later, “<a href="link.html?p=2&id=1123124202581545000">CCAN YOU HEAR ME</a>". They also managed to correctly guess “<a href="link.html?p=2&id=1123134061058211980">WWHY ARE YOU SO QUIET</a>". Bread then <a href="link.html?p=2&id=1123136546757935204">confirmed</a> that the same flame can sometimes look different, as copying them around is hard and there isn't much space to fit them in, and later <a href="link.html?p=2&id=1123142457341771838">showed</a> what the U (oo) flame was supposed to look like.<br><br>Another person joined the fire channel then, which gave another message: “<a href="link.html?p=2&id=1123136869421563935">C-ca_ ___ ____ __?</a>", though it displayed incorrectly due to Markdown formatting. The blanks were interpreted as meaning the same thing as the flames, “C-can you hear me?".<br><br>The gang also managed to translate the last message, “<a href="link.html?p=2&id=1123146856470429786">I HEAR YOU YOU HEAR ME?</a>", and Bread <a href="link.html?p=2&id=1123148599715446934">corrected</a> yet another mistake with the wisps. In these messages, the gang saw that the smoke pillars actually indicated <a href="link.html?p=2&id=1123149143754424381">question marks</a>, allowing them to correctly complete “A NEW VOICE? HIYA". They also noticed that the last flame on “PLEASE TALK TO ME!" was an exclamation mark.<br><br><a href="link.html?p=3&id=1123317348632367214">Another message</a> was also found, which was fully labelled as “WANNA PLAY WITH FIRE". The trigger for this message was then unknown, and <a href="link.html?p=4&id=1125455645651509248">later</a> thought to be “ENTRY NUMBER SEVENTEEN", though it most likely just triggered on any wingdings.</p>

                <h2>Dario</h2>

                <p><img src="dariofire.png" alt="dario" width=900>Later on June 27th, <a href="link.html?p=3&id=1123450703931781171">a new message</a> was sent when someone joined the fire channel, saying “A voice calls out to you from the flames... but you say nothing, and it slowly fades to silence...". The gang attempted to reply to the automod message, though that didn't accomplish anything. Bread then said a command had been <a href="link.html?p=3&id=1123452675959312404">missed</a> in the console, and then reverted it and made it more easily findable.<br><br>The gang then started trying to ask questions to the voice in the fire, in an attempt to find the command, and soon got <a href="link.html?p=3&id=1123457773389230132">a response</a> after asking “<a href="link.html?p=3&id=1123457893556031538">WHAT IS YOUR NAME?</a>". They quickly translated it as “<a href="link.html?p=3&id=1123460184560390194">DARIO</a>", though they also thought it could mean “<a href="link.html?p=3&id=1123460778071167046">DAREO</a>". They also found that saying DARIO back gave “<a href="link.html?p=3&id=1123460628917538917">HIYA</a>" and <a href="link.html?p=3&id=1123481512076132413">a smiley face</a> as a reply.<br><br>The gang also found a couple more messages shortly (though they had also seen Bread <a href="link.html?p=3&id=1123465590594601020">trigger them</a> a few minutes earlier). The first message was a response to saying “<a href="link.html?p=3&id=1123471416407359528">ARSON</a>"; it was quickly translated to “<a href="link.html?p=3&id=1123473698830176286">ARSON? YOU MADE A NICKNAME</a>". The gang then attempted asking “WHAT IS YOUR NAME?" again, but this time they got <a href="link.html?p=3&id=1123475716823076884">a new message</a>, which was translated to “<a href="link.html?p=3&id=1123478195858055219">FRIENDS CALL ME ARSON!</a>". Later, it was also found that (after some <a href="link.html?p=3&id=1123479723083829389">bugfixing</a>) asking “WHAT IS YOUR REAL NAME?" would get “<a href="link.html?p=3&id=1123480868523098222">DARIO</a>" as a response.<br><br>The gang also tried asking “<a href="link.html?p=3&id=1123484086044991548">WHERE ARE YOU?</a>", which got a new response that was then translated to “<a href="link.html?p=3&id=1123488203941359717">WILL YOU HELP ME?</a>". Later, while trying to fix a bug in the console where multiple flames could trigger at once, Bread said “<a href="link.html?p=3&id=1123511319891562567">YES OK okay SURE alright WHAT ALRIGHT</a>". Some parts of this triggered a new message, which was after a few hours translated to “<a href="link.html?p=3&id=1123559371499126827">ITS SO QUIET SO FEW OF YOU</a>". Another message was then added, triggered when saying “<a href="link.html?p=3&id=1123562772924485672">OK</a>", which translated to “<a href="link.html?p=3&id=1123563634564530230">TOO DARK I CANT SEE YOU</a>". The gang theorized that they needed to get more people to join the ARG by saying “I WANNA PLAY WITH FIRE" on Twitch. Bread then also said that some vowel flames had been <a href="link.html?p=3&id=1123783139731451925">fixed</a> some time before the last messages were found, and that screenshots from before then were incorrect.<br><br>The next few people that joined the Fire channel got new messages; the <a href="link.html?p=3&id=1123707295164026991">first one</a> said “A voice calls out to you from the flames... But the replies are lost and scattered, illegible in the darkness.", while the <a href="link.html?p=3&id=1123930355204890645">second</a> was “You see something flickering in a wisp of fire... but it was so cold... you couldn't make any thing out...".</p>

                <h2>Wanna hear a joke?</h2>

                <p><img src="joke.png" alt="fire rire joke" width=900>On June 29th, chat managed to beat Sans again in the test streams. <a href="link.html?p=3&id=1123853768094650469">A sign</a> had been added after the fight, which had some hints about wisps, question marks, and wingdings... all of which had already been found before reading the sign.<br><br>Later, a bot was created to complete Mettaton's tile puzzle, which made the gang get access to another sign. Due to a bug, this said the <a href="link.html?p=3&id=1123563634564530230">same thing</a> as the previous sign. The next day, the correct hint was added to the sign, and, after <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1860462063">running the bot</a> again, the gang was able to read it: “Hiya! Wanna hear a joke? What's the difference... Between a ‘fire' and a ‘rire?'... the render... of the ember!!! Hee hee hee!". They noticed this was a hint regarding how F and R were slightly different, though they didn't know what the difference was.<br><br>The gang then joked about trying every english word to see if it was a trigger, but then started actually <a href="link.html?p=3&id=1124689367307403307">trying</a> to do it. This didn't find any new triggers, and only managed to show <a href="link.html?p=3&id=1124690869149237340">multiple bugs</a> in the console instead. One of these bugs was <a href="link.html?p=3&id=1124714255049048064">exploited</a> a few times, to attempt to create “fake friends" for Arson; this was quickly patched with the help of many people, though.<br><br>A new join message was also <a href="link.html?p=3&id=1124742785208176770">added</a>: “You called out to the flames, but nobody came."</p>

                <h2>The Worst Way to Die To Sans</h2>

                <p><img src="firerire.png" alt="qario" width=795>On July 1st, 2023, Bread uploaded the video “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29KOS0bvz1I">The Worst Way to Die To Sans</a>".<br>Near the end of the video, after showing a clip of the tile puzzle, the screen glitches out. On the left side, text can be seen, apparently attempting to stop people from continuing with the ARG, saying sentences such as “Stay in the dark", “Don't help each other", and “You don't want to play with fire". The gang started calling this voice “<a href="link.html?p=3&id=1124789349968527372">Qario</a>", which originated from flipping Dario's “d" to a “q".<br><br>Below this text, a big message written in wingdings can be seen. It <a href="link.html?p=3&id=1124758978539294831">translates</a> to: “W-What?! No! It's not fair! They just started talking to me! Why can't they hear me?! What's going on?! Where are they going?! No! What's happening?! These aren't my letters! Why do they keep changing?! Help! I... I'm sorry! Please! I know you can hear me! I can't do this alone! Wait don't g"<br><br>After the glitch effect ends, fire can be seen scrolling by. It says roughly the same as the sign found in the stream: “HIYA WANNA HEAR A JOKE? WHATS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A FIRE & A RIRE THE RENDER OF THE EMBER!". There were wingdings labelling the flames on “FIRE" and “RIRE", though these were easily missable due to Youtube compression. A new, quickly drawn flame was used here for &, instead of the word “AND", which hasn't been used since then.<br>There was also an error with the flames: every H flame actually looked like a J. At first, the gang thought this was because of <a href="link.html?p=3&id=1124758389491241100">phonetics</a>, however Bread then confirmed it was a mistake, likely caused by <a href="link.html?p=3&id=1124765378493567139">Lynx jumping on their keyboard</a>. To try to correct this, they said that we could get a J flame by <a href="link.html?p=3&id=1124758389491241100">horizontally flipping</a> the H flame.</p>

                <h2>But nobody came</h2>

                <p><img src="nobodycame.png" alt="but nobody came" width=650>On June 3rd, <a href="link.html?p=3&id=1125249312864075816">another message</a> was found in the console. This was first triggered by saying the joke from the previous video; it was later found that the reason it triggered was the “OK" inside “JOKE", and the triggers <a href="link.html?p=4&id=1125483053771411638">were the same</a> as the previous few flames. This message was translated to “<a href="link.html?p=3&id=1125253051356287168">BUT NOBODY CAME</a>".<br>A small joke message was also added; saying “MARIO" gave the response “<a href="link.html?p=4&id=1125650426239402094">WHO?</a>".</p>
                <p>(skipping stuff here for now to document current streams)</p>

                <h2>Twitch Fights Sans</h2>

                <p><img src="colors.png" alt="wowie orang" width=750>On April 26th, 2024, Bread uploaded the video “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dxbl-xxYlP8">Can Twitch Chat Defeat Sans the Skeleton?</a>". In it, after talking about the Twitch Plays console and the previous Sans fights, they announced the date for a new Sans fight test stream.<br><br>On April 28th, which also happened to be the 1 year anniversary of the ARG, the stream started. It was very quickly found that random wingdings didn't trigger anything. The gang also tried many of the known triggers from the previous streams; it was found that “<a href="link.html?p=f&id=1234130160467443743">DARIO</a>", “<a href="link.html?p=f&id=1234131814319394898">ARSON</a>", “<a href="link.html?p=f&id=1234133242517389312">MARIO</a>", and “<a href="link.html?p=f&id=1234133624287133696">WHAT IS YOUR REAL NAME</a>" all gave the same responses as they used to. “<a href="link.html?p=f&id=1234133437724495972">WHAT IS YOUR NAME</a>" still got “...But nobody came..." as a response, however Bread later <a href="link.html?p=f&id=1234146210160574555">confirmed</a> that this fire was just a mistake.<br><br>When saying “I WANNA PLAY WITH FIRE", a few of the messages were the same as the old ones: saying it for the first time got “<a href="link.html?p=f&id=1234130256000979034">A NEW VOICE? HIYA</a>", and saying it after that would get “<a href="link.html?p=f&id=1234130773041479702">HIYA</a>". However, if you had said it on one of the previous streams, then the first time saying it on this one would get a new response: “<a href="link.html?p=f&id=1234130482904436797">WELCOME BACK FRIENDS :D</a>". This fire actually had an error, as the M flame <a href="link.html?p=f&id=1234147620033925231">had a cross</a> on it even though it shouldn't have been silent. Bread then made a fixed version of this fire, and accidentally <a href="link.html?p=f&id=1234148518994907187">leaked</a> the file with all of the ASCII art.<br><br>This file also had some unfinished art that wasn't meant to be found yet; Bread mentioned that it looked bad because online ASCII converters <a href="link.html?p=f&id=1234149124493017149">didn't work well</a>. In an attempt to fix this, a way to make <a href="link.html?p=f&id=1234385169037656196">colors</a> work in the console was found, which Bread then used to make the “DARIO" fire <a href="link.html?p=f&id=1234578268573663252">orange</a>.
