            <h2>ARG timeline</h2>

            <div class="stuff">
                <p>This is a timeline of all important parts of the ARG.<br>A lot of stuff on this page comes from previous documentation (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L8lss64v4yhjFzelrjX8q4ZSDIsvua9RwOeRL5b4K_0/edit">here</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Xw-MhgRxrfVnq03DkDZH8orkmXMzf-UT1CAMH6GxM08/edit">here</a>, and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OAVch6j-dHt7E3CJh1y9it2GqC5NZnfeXP4UYUHTI1c/edit">here</a>). Huge thanks to everyone who helped make those!</p>

                <p><img src="billcipherFIRE.png" alt="FIRE" width=1000 class="right">On April 28th, 2023, HalfBreadChaos uploaded the video “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9y1S0K48EVc">Is Bill Cipher in Owl House?</a>".<br>At around 12:54, flame sprites can be seen flickering. The first and last flames come from the sprite spr_hearthflame in Undertale and have no meaning, however there are 4 different flames in the middle. 3 of these flames have different colors, and the other has an eye on it, which is a clue for the meaning of the flame (“I").<br><br>With future knowledge, we can translate the flames to the message “FIRE".</p>

                <p><img src="maddummyWANNA.png" alt="WANNA FIRE" width=991 class="right">On May 12th, 2023, Bread uploaded the video “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skh6FmR_uuE">How Many Hits Does It Take to Kill the Mad Dummy</a>".<br>Near the end of the video, Bread discusses some ways that MysticSlime's Youtube Plays Undertale chat could have done to make the Mad Dummy fight easier. At 9:13, they say “I mean it's moot point now, since MysticSlime's stream is now over... but... suppose it was-", but then the video is cut off by a glitch effect.<br><br>After the glitch, 2 new sets of flames can be seen, one on the front and one on the back. Each set scrolls one flame forward every few frames.<br>The 5 flames looping on the front have a few hints for their meaning: “uu" (“double u", “W"), “hA" in wingdings (the letter is “A", and the “h" specifies how it's pronounced), N from Pokémon (the letter “N"), N again, and “hA" again. Put together, these flames mean “WANNA".<br>On the back, 3 of the flames are blank. The other flame has an eye on it, which, like in the previous video, means “I". Also like in the previous video, we now know that these flames spell “FIRE".</p>
                <p>The text “TO BE CONTINUED?" can then be seen in wingdings, which turns into normal text for a short time, and then into the [REDACTED] sprite.</p>

                <p>more stuff probably coming soon</p>
