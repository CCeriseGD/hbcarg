            <div class="stuff">
                <p>This is a timeline of all important parts of the ARG.<br>A lot of stuff on this page comes from previous documentation (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L8lss64v4yhjFzelrjX8q4ZSDIsvua9RwOeRL5b4K_0/edit">here</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Xw-MhgRxrfVnq03DkDZH8orkmXMzf-UT1CAMH6GxM08/edit">here</a>, and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dKw3JYYZp0igw0L7ZHTCje-Bc9d_Qh2AleEecxZcU9Y/edit">here</a>). Huge thanks to everyone who helped make those!</p>

                <h2>Is Bill Cipher in Owl House?</h2>

                <p><img src="billcipherFIRE.png" alt="FIRE" width=800>On April 28th, 2023, HalfBreadChaos uploaded the video “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9y1S0K48EVc">Is Bill Cipher in Owl House?</a>".<br>At around 12:54, flame sprites can be seen flickering. The first and last flames come from the sprite spr_hearthflame in Undertale and have no meaning, however there are 4 different flames in the middle. 3 of these flames have different colors, and the other has an eye on it, which is a clue for the meaning of the flame (“I").<br><br>With future knowledge, we can translate the flames to the message “FIRE".</p>

                <h2>How Many Hits Does It Take to Kill the Mad Dummy</h2>

                <p><img src="maddummyWANNA.png" alt="WANNA FIRE" width=800 class="pixel">On May 12th, 2023, Bread uploaded the video “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skh6FmR_uuE">How Many Hits Does It Take to Kill the Mad Dummy</a>".<br>Near the end of the video, Bread discusses some strategies that MysticSlime's Youtube Plays Undertale chat could have used to make the Mad Dummy fight easier. At 9:13, they say “I mean it's moot point now, since MysticSlime's stream is now over... but... suppose it was-", but then the video is cut off by a glitch effect.<br><br>After the glitch, 2 new sets of flames can be seen, one on the front and one on the back. Each set scrolls one flame forward every few frames.<br>The 5 flames looping on the front have a few hints for their meaning: “uu" (“double u", “W"), “hA" in wingdings (the letter is “A", and the “h" specifies how it's pronounced), N from Pokémon (the letter “N"), N again, and “hA" again. Put together, these flames mean “WANNA".<br>On the back, 3 of the flames are blank. The other flame has an eye on it, which, like in the previous video, means “I". Also like in the previous video, we now know that these flames spell “FIRE".<br><br>The text “TO BE CONTINUED?" can then be seen in wingdings, which turns into normal text for a short time, and then into the [REDACTED] sprite.</p>

                <h2>Initial discovery</h2>

                <p><img src="bric.png" alt="hey look its bric" width=558>On May 13th, 2023, Deltarune theorist Brixbraxium noticed the flames in the video for the first time, and started talking about them in the <a href="https://discord.gg/VxB7DR3JFC">Andrew Cunningham Discord Server</a> (<span class="nowrap"><span class="flip">A</span>CDS</span>).<br>A few people joined the discussion, such as PenguinPowerful and Icebrick1. They found the different symbols in the flames, and quickly understood what each one meant individually, but trying to piece it all together, they were just getting gibberish.<br><br>Brix then created <a href="https://discord.com/channels/919115374316908584/1106740444773232761/1106740582279290931">a thread</a> for this topic, where he theorized that this was teasing a Chat Plays Undertale run by Bread. The Fire Gang kept discussing the symbols and the possibility of a Chat Plays for a couple days, however they still couldn't understand the meaning of the flames.</p>

                <p><img src="comment.png" alt="hearted comment" width=902 class="right">On May 21st, Bread hearted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skh6FmR_uuE&lc=Ugx-kZypvftvAx0OsUV4AaABAg">a comment</a> Brix had left on the video, much later than they usually look at comments, which was immediately seen as important.</p>

                <h2>First community post</h2>

                <p><img src="communityWANNA.png" alt="WANNA community post" width=500>On May 26th, 2023, Bread made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/post/UgkxFHndjjNgMRymEL9A0pfGXeSTdMuEC2gp">a community post</a> announcing that that weeks video would be a few days late. There are 5 flames scattered across the images on the post, which say the same thing as in the Mad Dummy video: “WANNA".<br><br>Still, the Fire Gang was unable to figure out what they meant, instead theorizing that this could be a cipher or a bit.ly link.</p>

                <h2>Everything we know about Redacted in Undertale</h2>

                <p><img src="redactedPLAY.png" alt="PLAY" width=500>On May 29th, 2023, Bread uploaded “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QIV_aVOp78">Everything we know about Redacted in Undertale</a>".<br>At around 11:14, the screen explodes, and 4 flames can be seen randomly switching places around the screen for a few frames. These flames have some clues for their meaning: the first, third and fourth are P, A, and Y in wingdings, respectively, and the second is the character L from Death Note.<br>Also, the A flame here looks different from the A flame in WANNA. This is because the fire alphabet has different flames for different sounds of the same letters. The A in WANNA makes an “Ah" sound, while the A in PLAY makes an “Ay" sound.<br><br>Put together with the flames from the previous video, the message so far is “WANNA PLAY".</p>

                <p><img src="comment2.png" alt="hearted comment 2" width=600>Brix <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QIV_aVOp78&lc=Ugz4nidHIPmkTsEzmed4AaABAg">commented</a> on this video too, and again, the comment got hearted by Bread. They also replied to it, saying there was an entire community dissecting these where they can't see it, referring to the <span class="nowrap"><span class="flip">A</span>CDS</span> thread. After just a few minutes, the Fire Gang figured out these flames meant PLAY, and, looking back at the previous video, they understood the full message to mean “I WANNA PLAY" or “HI WANNA PLAY".<br><br>After decoding the meaning, Brix realized that someone must have told Bread about them investigating the flames.<br>Penguin joked that there were spies from Bread's Patreon server telling them about it, and Brix joked about Bread being in the server on an alt.<br><br>Brix then left <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QIV_aVOp78&lc=UgwXXm7NPIZC31ReEqB4AaABAg">another comment</a> on the video, mentioning what they had found so far. This one also was hearted by Bread, prompting more jokes about Bread's alt being there. The Fire Gang then started looking at every account that joined, in case one of them actually was Bread.</p>

                <h2>Patreon invites</h2>

                <p><img src="patreon.png" alt="after patreon invites or smth idk im tired why am i writing alt text">On May 31st, 2023, an account named Quinn joined the server.<br>On the thread, Penguin asked if the account was suspicious. <a href="https://ccerisegd.github.io/firebackup/patreon/backup.html#chatlog__message-container-1113843998591828009">A group chat</a> was then made, where the gang discussed how possible it was for the account to be Bread. They quickly noticed that Quinn was the name of one of Bread's cats, and that it had an about me mentioning cats, among other things. They then deleted some of the messages about the account in the thread, and started discussing Bread video lore to act like everything was normal.<br><br>Around an hour later, Brix mentioned not having access to Bread's server because it was paywalled. Bread then DM'd a few of the people involved, and gave them free invites to the Patreon server to properly discuss the ARG, as a reward for being the first people to discover it. They also confirmed that their editor, Mollystars, had told them about the thread.<br><br><a href="https://ccerisegd.github.io/firebackup/patreon/backup.html">A channel</a> was then created for the ARG, where the main discussion moved to for the next few weeks.</p>

                <h2>First TPU test stream</h2>

                <p><img src="fcw.png" alt="FLAMES CRACKLE AND WHISPER" width=400>On June 5th, 2023, Bread announced <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1838268087">a bug testing stream</a> for Twitch Plays Undertale, where people had access to a few unused rooms to try and find bugs in the console.<br><br>During a stream on June 7th, Bread asked Mel-Woif how they typed wingdings. They said they use a translator, and tried saying “<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1839802692?t=42453s">TESTING TESTING</a>" in wingdings. The console then printed some broken ASCII art. A few minutes later, Bread managed to fix the issue, and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1839802692?t=42588s">using wingdings</a> started showing the correct fire ASCII art.<br><br>With future knowledge, we can translate this message as “FLAMES CRACKLE AND WHISPER", though it has an artstyle that's not used in any other ASCII fire messages.<br><br>The Fire Gang wondered if these flames had meaning, however they had no way of translating the message, so it wasn't even mentioned outside of Twitch chat for a few days.</p>

                <h2>Second community post</h2>

                <p><img src="communityWITH.png" alt="WITH" width=600>On June 9th, 2023, Bread made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/post/UgkxlS8TgKdEI_dei33zUKj0ohp92ki33_CR">a community post</a> talking about the test streams.<br><br>One of the images was a screenshot of the previously found “FLAMES CRACKLE AND WHISPER" message. However, it had a few changes: two of the flames on the console had wingdings on them, reading “WI", and Bread's sprite in the corner had two flames added, with wingdings on top reading “TH". This made the full message so far “HI WANNA PLAY WITH". The Fire Gang speculated that it could continue as “HI WANNA PLAY WITH ME".</p>

                <h2>A new voice</h2>

                <p><img src="newvoice.png" alt="A NEW VOICE? HIYA" width=800>On June 12th, 2023, Lindfate said “<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1844225871?t=50269s">hi wanna play</a>" in wingdings in chat.<br>The console then printed a new fire message, which we now know means “A NEW VOICE? HIYA". The trigger for this message was meant to be “hi wanna play with fire", however, due to a coding error, it triggered with just “play"<br><br>After experimenting for a few minutes, the Fire Gang found another fire message. It triggered when saying “<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1844225871?t=50549s">hi wanna play</a>" more than once, and was just the last word from the other message: “HIYA". However, the flames in this message were labelled with their respective letters.<br><br>The Fire Gang discussed what this meant, wondering what “HIYA" was and theorizing this could lead to Bread making a game, or, a flamethrower brand, for some reason.<br><br>Brix mentioned this could be the last fire message, which Bread said was bold to assume.</p>

                <h2>Flame labels</h2>

                <p><img src="labelled.png" alt="FLAME CAN WHISPER" width=800>A few hours later, the code was updated, labelling some flames in the fire messages.<br>The original “FLAMES CRACKLE AND WHISPER" message <a href="https://discord.com/channels/919115374316908584/1106740444773232761/1117830227322744834">was changed</a> to show labels on the letters “FLAME C AN WHISPER", while “A NEW VOICE? HIYA" had labels <a href="https://ccerisegd.github.io/firebackup/patreon/backup.html#chatlog__message-container-1117950808206618686">added</a> on “NEW VOICE".<br><br>The gang discussed for a few minutes whether this could mean the flames made meaningful sounds; this ended up not being the case, though.</p>

                <h2>Twitch Plays Undertale server</h2>

                <p><img src="burnttoash.png" alt="message burnt to ash">On June 13th, 2023, Bread sent an invite to <a href="https://discord.gg/nvQburYkWJ">a new server</a> made for Twitch Plays Undertale.<br><br>Some time after joining, the Fire Gang started discussing the fire messages they had found so far. However, after just a few minutes, something odd happened: when saying certain keywords related to the ARG, such as “i wanna play with fire", the message would be <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1117766959266791484/1118149995670032495/1118215783563141272">deleted</a>, and automod would then say it “burnt to ash"; it would also give you the Glass role, which granted access to the <a href="https://ccerisegd.github.io/firebackup/fire/part1.html">Fire channel</a>. Within the Fire channel, it would send another message, saying “You hear a voice crackling through the flames...". It then quickly deleted both messages.</p>

                <h2>Testing stream signs</h2>

                <p><img src="signs.png" alt="signs" width=800>Later that day, Brix, Penguin, ChaoticCookie and YanaTheWeird managed to beat Sans while using a buffed Temmie Armor.<br>When they walked farther into the Judgement Hall, they saw <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1846007925?t=0h0m36s">a sign</a>, which read “Be silent at the cross.". This was a hint for the flame alphabet, as flames with a cross shaped wisp indicate silent letters. However, this was not known at the time.<br><br>After defeating Sans, the Fire Gang also got access to New Home. They started backtracking through the CORE, until they reached Hotland, where they realized they could enter Mettaton's tile puzzle room from the other side, skipping the puzzle. However, when they got there, they accidentally went back into the door, putting them back in the Judgement Hall, and with Sans still alive.<br><br>For a short time they thought they would have to beat Sans again, however, they realized that they had saved while backtracking. They then went to the tile puzzle, and intentionally lost, which let them go back to the menu, and get back to New Home. They again backtracked to Hotland, and managed to read <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1846007925?t=0h21m53s">the sign</a>: “Every flame has a sound. Have you heard them before?". This also was a hint for the flame alphabet, as each flame represents a sound.<br><br>The next day, <a href="https://ccerisegd.github.io/firebackup/patreon/backup.html#chatlog__message-container-1118544105442648094">echo flowers</a> were added to the hub, one repeating “Every flame has a sound..." “Have you heard them before?", the other simply saying “cross". A few hours later, <a href="https://ccerisegd.github.io/firebackup/fire/part1.html#chatlog__message-container-1118587567806349312">another sign</a> was found, saying “Come on, you can figure this one out. Each flame is a letter, silly!".</p>

                <p>more stuff probably coming soon</p>
