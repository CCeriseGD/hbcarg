            <p>Each flame in the fires that Dario speaks in corresponds to a letter (more accurately, a sound).<br>This fire can be decoded as a message using this chart on the right.<br><br>All vowel flames were sent by Bread when we picked them after catching a shiny jirachi in Pokemon Infinite Fusion.<br>Bread also confirmed that there are 25 vowel sounds, 25 consonants from B to N, 20 consonants from P to Z, and 20 punctuation marks, though another vowel flame was used a few times so we dont know how correct this is.</p> <img src="arg.png" alt="" width=812 class="right">
